# recom-restaurants
An Android App using the Yelp API to recommend restaurants based on user preference

Based on user preference (e.g. mile radius, price level, type of food) and GPS location, 
users will be able to scroll through several recommended restaurants and select the one they wish to view.
The restaurants stats will be displayed and the user can choose to see the restaurant's location relative
to their own GPS location.
